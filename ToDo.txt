1) Tweak TwitterScrape  search  function  to ensure 100% accuracy
	-  Also figure out  how to populate the 'not found' companies with Twitter accounts / how to find  these companies on Twitter
	2) Scrape top 100 tweets (liked, retweeted) where company handle or hashtag is mentioned. Feed to Akshit's reviewModel (to determine if valid review model or not) and populate Company.reviews with this data. 
		- Add reviews attribute and method to add (addReviews). reviews should probably be a list containing strings (of the tweets).
